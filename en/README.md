Explore how an agent runtime connects the conversation loop, tools, permissions, memory, and orchestration. Fifteen chapters and four appendices connect implementation details to design trade-offs and a hands-on harness project.

> *“Of all artifacts that bring many crafts together, the chariot calls upon the most.”* — *Kǎo Gōng Jì* (Book of Crafts)
>
> Two thousand years ago, building a chariot was already an exercise in systems engineering. The **yú** (舆, carriage body) carries the rider; shafts, spokes, and axle fittings each serve their purpose. Only together can the vehicle move.
>
> Building an AI Agent calls for similar coordination: the conversation loop advances the task, tools perform actions, and permissions set boundaries. The runtime framework that supports and organizes these capabilities—**Agent Harness**—plays the role of the **yú**.
>
> Chariot builders brought many crafts into one working whole. Agent builders, too, must understand how the parts work together. **Yù Yú** (御舆, “driving the chariot”) evokes both control and an understanding of the machinery that makes it possible.
>
> This is the idea behind the title **Yù Yú**, also known as **Yú Shū** (舆书, “The Chariot Book”).

## Start reading

- **First visit:** [Foreword](00-Foreword.md), then chapters 01 → 02 → 04 → 15.
- **Build an agent:** read Parts 1 and 4; use Parts 2 and 3 when adding memory and extensions.
- **Look up a concept:** use the four appendices below.
- **Website:** [Online reading](https://lintsinghua.github.io/). Repository chapters remain directly readable on GitHub.

## Second volume · Omp (in progress)

This repository now carries a second, separate volume: the Chinese-language 《Omp 从入门到精通：原理与实战》 — an unofficial tutorial for an open-source terminal agent. Its manuscript lives in [../omp/](../omp/README.md) and its artifacts use the `yuyu-omp-*` prefix. It is written against **omp/18.15.0**; [../omp/VERIFY.md](../omp/VERIFY.md) records what was checked against a real install (18.16.0 included).

Two commands, two books: `make book` / `make book-pdf` still build Yù Yú only (both languages), while `make book-omp` / `make book-omp-pdf` build the Chinese omp edition — the latter also prints an A4 PDF. The equivalent command is `python scripts/bookctl.py build --product omp --lang zh [--pdf]`. Both write into `yuyu-book/dist/` under different prefixes, so building one volume never overwrites the other. Build details, plus the sizes and page counts measured on this machine, are in [../omp/BUILD.md](../omp/BUILD.md); the mechanism and boundaries of the two-product setup are §3.6 of [../STRUCTURE.md](../STRUCTURE.md).

`make check` / `make check-full` (that is, `bookctl check --fast` / `--full`) cover Yù Yú assembly, shared tests and repository content checks. Omp has separate structure and delivery gates in `omp/overhaul/audit_structure.py --check` and `audit_delivery.py`. Content CI also assembles the Chinese Omp sources; Book CI has an independent `omp` job for HTML/PDF. On Windows, run `powershell -File omp/overhaul/ci-local.ps1` to build Yù Yú Chinese HTML and Omp Chinese HTML/PDF together.

Reading routes are available from the [Yù Yú side](../docs/COMPARE-OMP.md) and the [Omp side](../omp/COMPARE-YUYU.md), with a [shared terminology table](../docs/yuyu-overhaul/SHARED-TERMS.md). The Omp English edition has only a [reserved directory](omp/README.md); translation and English builds have not started.

Illustration strategy: Mermaid architecture diagrams and hand-drawn concept art on two tracks. Concepts can be read across the two volumes; implementations and pinned versions cannot be mixed.

## Reading notes

Readers should distinguish observed implementation, architectural interpretation, and teaching examples. Feature flags and tool availability depend on build and runtime configuration; counts and timing examples are not promises about current releases.

## The book as one file

`yuyu-book/` assembles the 20 units into **a single book you can read offline**: one self-contained HTML file (6.3 MB Chinese / 6.4 MB English) and an A4-typeset PDF (520 pages / 34.8 MB in Chinese, 559 pages / 23.7 MB in English). Artifacts land in `yuyu-book/dist/`. PDF page counts and sizes depend on the installed CJK font. These figures use CI's Noto CJK face, not a local Windows measurement; each build log reports the actual results.

These measurements come from the [merged Full run](https://github.com/zhuguang-ZFG/claude-code-book/actions/runs/42473136200). Its ten build checks passed. The final SVGs are smaller than the candidate artwork, taking the measured CI English HTML size from a rounded 6.5 MB to 6.4 MB; the unchanged README then failed reconciliation. Only the measured claims are corrected here, not the rules in `scripts/check_artifact_claims.py`. The published `v0.3.6` tag and assets remain unchanged.

| File | Language |
|------|----------|
| `yuyu-agent-harness-zh.html` / `.pdf` | Chinese |
| `yuyu-agent-harness-en.html` / `.pdf` | English |

The book includes a cover, imprint and license page, revision history, reading routes, a contents page with page numbers, and a full-book route map on its own sheet. The foreword is the wheel at the head of the road; fifteen chapters form four serpentine legs, with the appendices on a dashed siding. Each chapter opens with a compass card — its question, deliverable and boundary — and source anchors. All 160 diagrams per edition (320 across both) are pre-rendered Mermaid diagrams; 17 explanatory drawings bring the numbered figure count to 177 per edition. Code-language labels, footnotes, sources and a subject index complete the reading apparatus; the Chinese index also has a Chinese-term section after A–Z.

Artwork uses a mixed format. Emblems, the postman and explanatory figures remain hand-drawn animated SVG; the first two part openers use reviewed, generated transparent-ink PNGs. The cover and remaining part openers retain SVG. Unit-specific header strokes, closing wheel ruts and part-opening roads follow the reading route. Wide screens (≥1360 px) also have a persistent contents rail. All images travel inside the offline file; dark-screen inversion does not invert the ink on paper.

The PDF adds sidebar bookmarks, foot folios, recto/verso running heads, a subject index with target page numbers, and clickable “see Chapter N” references. Chapters do not leave a sheet containing only a running head and folio. A diagram too wide for the portrait column gets a landscape sheet, with selectable, searchable labels. Long names such as `KAIROS_GITHUB_WEBHOOKS`, `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` and `~/.claude/settings.json` gain break points at underscores, slashes and camel-case seams — not inside ordinary English words — to reduce stretched spacing and table overflow. The HTML opens with the network unplugged, without external fonts, images or scripts.

Engineers new to the material can enter through the **plain-language layer**: each chapter starts with one sentence and an everyday analogy, while a dotted underline opens a three-line explanation — what a term means, why it works that way, and a picture to hold onto. When a term appears only as inline code, the underline sits on the identifier, so names such as `AbortController` remain discoverable. Popovers pin to the bottom of narrow screens or scrolling tables rather than being clipped. On paper, chapter-end term panels and *Why It Works This Way* carry the explanations; the 44 core terms' reasons are filed under the chapters that argue for them. Start / Core / Advanced stamps correspond to the foreword's three reading routes.

An old postman closes each unit with one line of marginalia. The 20 lines live in `yuyu-book/notes.json`, and *The Keeper's Notes* collects them in reading order with links back to their chapters. A term lock requires each line to use a registered form actually present in that chapter. Chinese lines stay within 36 characters; English lines within 130, with no Han characters. The keeper does not become a second manuscript.

43 hand-drawn line illustrations remain as source SVGs: a cover, 20 unit emblems, four part openers, one postman, and seventeen plates inside the prose. Those figures explain relationships or states — pause versus cancel, permission gates, the memory funnel, a fork filmstrip, a state dial and a concurrency gate, among others. Apart from the two part openers now using ink PNGs, the drawings retain `currentColor` SVG and the same meaning in dark mode, reduced motion and print. The whole plain-language layer can be disabled with `--no-plain`.

```bash
npm ci                                              # diagrams need Mermaid 11.17.2
python -m pip install -r yuyu-book/requirements.txt
python scripts/bookctl.py doctor                    # list every missing piece and its fix
python scripts/bookctl.py check --fast              # full Fast tier: dependencies, source assembly, both suites, content/diagram syntax, video, product idempotence
python scripts/bookctl.py build --product book --lang zh
python scripts/bookctl.py build --product book --lang both --pdf
```

`requirements.txt` is exported from `uv.lock` with exact pins. To upgrade, edit `pyproject.toml`, then run `uv lock` and `uv export --format requirements-txt --no-hashes --no-emit-project --no-annotate > yuyu-book/requirements.txt`; do not edit the export by hand.

Rendering diagrams and building PDFs needs a local Chromium or Edge (auto-detected, or pass `--browser <path>`). The Markdown chapters are the single source of truth: the build reads them and never rewrites a file.

## Building and releasing

`scripts/bookctl.py` is the repository's single command entry point; `make` only wraps it, and the builder can also be run directly as `python -m yuyu_book` (from `yuyu-book/`, or with `PYTHONPATH=yuyu-book`). Checks are layered: **Fast** (pull-request tier: pinned dependencies, source-mode assembly, both unittest suites, content checks, Mermaid syntax, video configuration, product idempotence), **Full** (main-branch or manual: Fast plus rendered assembly and both PDF editions), and **Release** (tag or manual: Full plus artifact-claim reconciliation, then release assembly to produce checksums and the release directory). In CI these are the `Fast` / `Full` / `Omp` / `Bootstrap` jobs in `.github/workflows/book.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`; the old `check-book.yml` has been folded into `Fast` and no longer exists.

The release directory is assembled atomically by the command below (its version must equal the `version` in `yuyu-book/manifest.json`; `--epub` is optional):

```bash
python scripts/bookctl.py release --version 0.3.6 --out-dir ../book-release --epub
```

It holds both HTML/PDF editions, the Chinese Omp HTML/PDF, optional EPUBs, `site.zip`, 15 chapter video manifests, `release-notes.json` plus `release-notes.md` (the body `gh release` publishes), `SHA256SUMS`, and `build-report.json` / `artifact-manifest.json`, which record commands, commit, browser/font identity and artifact hashes. A failed step never leaves a partial release directory.

**Status (2026-11-08):** `v0.3.6` was assembled and published by the tag-push run of `release.yml` ([run 42423483244](https://github.com/zhuguang-ZFG/claude-code-book/actions/runs/42423483244)) as a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/zhuguang-ZFG/claude-code-book/releases/tag/v0.3.6): 15 assets covering three editions of HTML/PDF/EPUB, `site.zip`, the 15 chapter video manifests, `SHA256SUMS`, and both build reports; all 14 published files match their `SHA256SUMS` entries. The P3/P5 gates still await independent review, and `task_verify` remains unverified. See the [architecture decisions](../docs/architecture-decisions.md), [P3 structural comparison](../docs/migrations/legacy-v2-structure.md), [product-page visual audit](../docs/migrations/product-visual-audit.md) and [release migration note](../docs/migrations/release-migration.md).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Include the chapter, section, expected correction, and a source link; for rendering problems, include the viewer and reproduction steps. Keep Chinese and English changes aligned. English manuscripts must contain no Han text except the Chinese-translation column in Appendix D; the build tests scan every line.

Before submitting, run `python3 scripts/bookctl.py check --fast`; it runs dependency reconciliation, source-mode assembly, both unittest suites, `scripts/check_book.py`, `npm run check:diagrams`, video configuration and product idempotence. Use `check --full` when diagrams or PDFs are involved. Mermaid validation requires Node.js 22 or later; run `npm ci` first. See [STRUCTURE.md](../STRUCTURE.md) for the repository layout and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow.

The technical narrative is checked against Claude Code `2.1.310` plus the official documentation, Anthropic research posts, the MCP specification, and community discussion. Every external source — with the tag or commit it is pinned to, the access date, and its licensing posture — is registered in [CREDITS.md](../CREDITS.md) and `yuyu-book/sources.json` (55 entries, 22 of them GitHub repositories), and reachable from the book's own sources page. Those repository entries do two different jobs: some are **authorities** (Claude Code itself, the official SDKs, the MCP specification, Anthropic's research posts); the rest are **cross-checks** — what the same boundary grows into in someone else's hands: a swappable model route, another context strategy, a second protocol, what permissions degrade to when nobody is watching, how large a packaged unit of capability can get. A cross-check supports no technical claim. It exists to test whether the seams the book names really are seams. Thanks to the [Linux.Do](https://linux.do/) community; most of the discussion happens in [the book's release thread](https://linux.do/t/topic/1870593).
