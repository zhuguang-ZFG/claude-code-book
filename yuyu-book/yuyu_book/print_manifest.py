"""PrintManifest: the typed hand-off from the HTML build to the PDF pass.

The PDF pass used to receive a plain dict assembled in `app.pdf_meta()`. A
missing key then surfaced as a `KeyError` deep inside PyMuPDF work, after the
expensive Chromium print, and a mistyped anchor surfaced as "no destination"
with no hint which list it came from. This module gives that hand-off a shape:
three frozen records, each validated where it is built, so a bad outline is
rejected before the browser launches.

The contract is positional on purpose. Bookmarks and running heads are read
left to right from `outline`, the contents pages number `toc_rows` in the
order the page prints them, and the subject index stamps `index_rows` by
anchor. A list that is silently reordered moves numbers to somebody else's
section, so every anchor must be unique and every row must point at a
bookmarked section.
