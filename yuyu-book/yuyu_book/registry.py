"""Versioned registry loading for the JSON files beside the manuscript.

Each registry declares its own `schema_version`. The loader is the only place
that knows how to read one, so a future shape change lands in a migration
function instead of a compatibility branch scattered through the builder.

`subject-index.json` is a list by nature: its version lives in an envelope
(`{"schema_version": 1, "entries": [...]}`), and `load()` hands callers the
list. Every other registry is an object; the loader strips the version key so
consumers never see it.

A missing `schema_version` is read as version 0 and migrated in memory. Files
are only rewritten by an explicit command (`build.py --regen-index`), never as
a side effect of loading.
